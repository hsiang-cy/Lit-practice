# DOM emulation

When running in Node, Lit automatically imports and uses a set of DOM shims, and defines the customElements global. Only the minimal DOM interfaces needed to define and register components are implemented. These include a few key DOM classes and a roughly functioning CustomElementRegistry.

âœ… signifies item is implemented to be functionally the same as in the browser.
