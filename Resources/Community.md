Follow us at @buildWithLit on Twitter for the latest on Lit and web components. Many of our team members can also be found tweeting about Lit, and the latest developments in the web platform.

Talk about Lit on GitHub Discussions. For longer questions or ideas about Lit, or to see what others are talking about, GitHub discussions are a great way to connect with the team and community.
